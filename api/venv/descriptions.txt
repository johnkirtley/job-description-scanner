The Platform Core team owns and operates an internal platform for deploying the ever growing number of microservices that make up the DigitalOcean cloud. The platform is built on top of Kubernetes and responsible for deployments of large (hundreds of cores and hundreds of GB of memory) and small (fractions of a cpu and MB of memory), servicing internal customers from all across the company in clusters all across the world. We internalized the DigitalOcean mission and apply that same principle of simplicity to how engineers interact with that platform.  Reporting to the Engineering Manager of the Platform Core team you will build solutions that provide DigitalOcean engineers with a robust and comprehensive set of primitives for bringing a service from development to production. We believe that by providing the right set of tools and automation our engineering teams can focus on shipping innovative products to our customers faster and more reliably.
